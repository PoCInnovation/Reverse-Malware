# Cursed Virus

## What is this virus ?
Cursed.exe is a video game that was promoted to many YouTubers. However, it wasn't what it seemed. Instead, it was a stealer, attempting to gather cookies, authentication tokens (and more) as much as possible.

This research paper discusses what this stealer is searching for and how it sends data.

## Why the virus is in a password protected .zip ?
Upon reading this, you need to understand that it is malicious code, and it should never run on your machine without appropriate security measures (such as a virtual machine)."

The password is : reversemalware

We distribute this for education purposes only, by demonstrating our tools for deobfuscating this malware.

## How to test the deobfuscator ?

Go to the **bin** directory and unzip:
```sh
cd bin && unzip cursed.zip
```

Go to the **deobfuscator** directory:
```sh
cd ../deobfuscator
```

Install the NPM Packages (**nodejs** and **npm** should be already installed on your system):
```sh
npm i
```

Execute **ast.js**, it will output the deobfuscated version of the malware as **"./output/index_deob.js"** :
```sh
node ast.js ../bin/index.js
```
